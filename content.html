	    Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, popularly known as Mahatma Gandhi, was born on 2nd October 1869. He was a lawyer by profession. He could have practiced law and spent a comfortable life. However, he chose to fight the British by participating in India's struggle for freedom.

	    Mahatma Gandhi was known for his unique ways of fighting the British. His ideologies were different from those of most freedom fighters. The British behaved cruelly with the Indians. They treated them like animals. They loaded them with work and paid them meagrely. This invoked anger in many Indians who came forward to fight the British. Filled with the feeling of hurt and anger, they took to aggressive means to drive the British officials out of the Country. However, Mahatma Gandhi chose a completely different way, thereby astonishing the others.

	    Like a father, he guided millions of Indians toward the right path in life. He taught his people to speak the truth no matter what the consequences. He strongly believed that one can attain success in life only if he has the courage to accept and speak the truth. A person who treads on the path of truth may face hardships on his way but will eventually see success. He also inspired his people to adopt non-violent means to further their plans â€“ teaching only a parent can give to his children.
